You can also generate gas reports by running:

REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test
Deploy Contracts: Deploy the contracts to your desired network. Modify scripts/deploy.ts if necessary and then run:
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.ts
Run Local Node: Spin up a local Ethereum node for development purposes.


npx hardhat node
Frontend README
