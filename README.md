Blockchain README
Getting Started

To initiate blockchain development, follow these steps:

Install Dependencies: Ensure Node.js is installed on your system.
bash
Copy code
npm install
Environment Setup: Create a .env file in the project's root directory. Provide necessary environment variables like the network private key or mnemonic number.
plaintext
Copy code
PRIVATE_KEY=<your_private_key_here>
MNEMONIC=<your_mnemonic_phrase_here>
Compile Contracts: Use Hardhat to compile smart contracts.
bash
Copy code
npx hardhat compile
Run Tests: Execute tests to ensure contracts behave as expected.
bash
Copy code
npx hardhat test
For gas reports, run:

bash
Copy code
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test
Deploy Contracts: Deploy contracts to your chosen network. Modify scripts/deploy.ts if needed, then run:
bash
Copy code
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.ts
Run Local Node: Spin up a local Ethereum node for development.
bash
Copy code
npx hardhat node
Additional Notes

Ensure correct private key or mnemonic is provided in the .env file for seamless contract deployment and interaction.
Frontend README
Getting Started

To begin frontend development, follow these steps:

Install Dependencies: Ensure Node.js is installed.
bash
Copy code
npm install
Start Development Server: Run the development server using:
bash
Copy code
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
Additional Configuration

If your frontend connects to a MongoDB database, ensure the MongoDB URI is added to your server configuration.
For blockchain integration, refer to the blockchain project's README for details on connecting to the blockchain network.
Project Overview

#ANOTHER  WAY IN CODESPACES
# Navigate to the client directory
cd client

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Add react-scripts as a development dependency
yarn add --dev react-scripts

# Run the development server
npm run dev   # or yarn dev

The project combines blockchain technology with frontend development to provide a decentralized solution. Smart contracts manage transactions securely, while the frontend provides a user-friendly interface for interacting with the blockchain network and any connected databases.
